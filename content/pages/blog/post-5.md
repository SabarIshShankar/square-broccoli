  Estne, quaeso, inquam, sitienti in bibendo voluptas? Iam in altera
  philosophiae parte. Quem Tiberina descensio festo illo die tanto gaudio
  affecit, quanto.

While this can be causing severe effects in the long term, the benefits of the producer are something like a dream. Its time isn't just allocated for just social media, but for apps in general. You might be thinking we are going nowhere, the percentage of usage has increased by 30% from 2019. The reason obviously is the pandemic, which only gives us more opportunities to become lazier. The overall average screen time varies for every demographic, and the usage ranges from social apps to games and many more. The usage of other means of entertainment has drastically reduced over the years, and this mainly points focus on generation Z. While it may be most difficult to filter down to find out what app drives the most traffic amongst the youngsters, it's viable that TikTok is definitely topping the list.

7% use iPhone and the rest use android and don't expect the world will get better in terms of productivity when 5g steps into everyone's phones, this situation is going to deepen and create a bigger room for itself. The other breakout apps, over the years, aren't just social media apps, but they fall under the umbrella of entertainment, and some meaningful ones. In terms of productivity, yeah there are a lot of 'apps' out there, but who do you think uses them. Just the ones that are aware of themselves.

Talking about China, which is on a whole new wave on the internet, its created massive breakout apps too. Recently the government announced that it'll be limiting kids' usage time to 3 hrs a week? Most games and apps are finding success over different demographics, making it quite possible for anyone to succeed the same way.

Indians, more so use mobile phones the same way but for an even longer duration. E-learning has become so fledged in places like India, where one can almost see every kid using them. It is something to notice, as kids have been immune to proper exposure like online learning. Just to create a psychological effect on human brains, big apps are using tricks to retain you. It is quite easy to escape this loop of sticking onto your phones every day. It is just that looking out for more in the real world.

With the percentage increasing like this, it raised concerns of privacy, piracy, and cyber threat issues. While we can agree most of us are doing something useful, there are a set of people who are mundane on their phones.
