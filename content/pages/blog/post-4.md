False information has been costing people's time, space, and sometimes even life. This new wave can potentially be dangerous for almost everyone. It is a critical and important problem running around the society that manipulates and breeds through our lives. It is a deliberate mistake created to deceive the public audiences. With the increase in the outreach with all the mediums we have, it is almost impossible to follow along to diagnose the problem. The latest news articles have stated that people circulating misinformation about COVID-19 has cost the lives of several people. It is for the characteristic livelihood, people spread fake information. 

A person spreads fake news online once he interprets it, making it reach out further. The effect of message attributes that include the true source and the consensus indicator, viewer characteristics like beliefs, empathy, consistency between the messages contribute the favor towards fake information. The participation of the users in the digital world and the consistency rate the process as well. As research states that "computational propaganda has been described as a pervasive and ubiquitous part of modern everyday life", it is true. Misinformation can also change our inbuilt attitude, our views on politics, life, civil society, and the polarizing groups.

The target or the reason behind this might be the authority and the context factor created to deviate the thoughts of the masses. Though the majority do not spread false information, people who intentionally want to prove things wrong do. While this is a certainty of all social media platforms together, the misinformation that used to be spread on Facebook about politics was beyond measures.
