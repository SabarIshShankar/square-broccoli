subtitle: What can humans do to stop this mess?

A deeper look into Climate Change - One big problem, people are going to be regretting.

Every day humans are getting one step closer to destroying the world and we are destroying it with our own hands. We live in an era where everything is focused on one's self, making us unaware of our surroundings, not just nature but family. United Nations have provided statistics saying 2019 has been the warmest year on record. The world is facing serious problems. To organize and solve this problem, nations are joining together to act on goals at the 26th UN Climate change conference. India and other countries have taken plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and try to work on this problem overall. India targets to cut its emissions by 35% by 2030, create power generated from Non-fossil fuel. Climate change is causing problems that are directly associated with health, agriculture, food, and water.

The mere problem here is that climate change is causing heavier rainfall, floods, fires. A warmer world is what we live in. A small temperature rise will cause evaporation, leading to the meltdown of caps and eventually more water. With the situation getting worse, small bad changes will only lead to bigger problems. Human activities cause an increase in greenhouse gases. The Carbon diOxide concentration has gone up to 550ppm causing it to be a global average contributor to climate change.

Forest fires in the US have destroyed an average of 5000 square miles every year for the past twenty years. Arguably problems like these arise due to climate change. The wildfires all over the world are mostly due to the same. The air is polluted at the same time humans are as well. Just cause we are not in the best mental or physical shape we cannot be contributing to this global mess. weather patterns change, food condition is getting worse, life is prone to suffering.

As per climate experts, fossil fuels are another primary resource that contributes to the majority of this problem, and just yet, it all happened in the last few decades.

It is also a phenomenon under which there are many technical words used that no man can understand. Though it's based on science, and scientists climate change is a real problem, acting right now is the best way to stop experiencing worse situations. It isn't a personal problem but a problem for life as a whole. One small step for man one big step for mankind.
