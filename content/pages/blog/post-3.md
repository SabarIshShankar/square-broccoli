  Quis est, qui non oderit libidinosam, protervam adolescentiam? Innumerabilia
  dici possunt in hanc sententiam, sed non necesse est. Putabam equidem satis,
  inquit, me dixisse.

Everyone knows how Facebook's name was changed to Meta, over the last week. Not many people know how it will affect the brand overall. Views might be wrong, but one can only see what Facebook does next. Recently the company said that it would no longer be using face recognition, whereas the real deal is Facebook just shutting them down. Metaverse which is mostly about connecting with people in virtual reality will most probably be using some sort of technology that is more than similar to facial recognition. Hyper-Realistic avatars and worlds to interact with people, Facebook announced last week. 

While that could all be hyped up, have you ever watched facebook app's videos, for a short second at least, when you were back after a long time? Those videos show what the world is actually watching. Watching those kinds of videos on the metaverse would probably not feel good. Talking about the facial recognition system getting shut down, it gives people a more valid sense of privacy, as we know the company is not the best when it comes to privacy. Meta obviously will be using biometrics and methods like the Deep face algorithm will not fall through. Although they do have certain drawbacks, the result is great as ever. 

An article on vox says “We believe this technology has the potential to enable positive use cases in the future that maintain privacy, control, and transparency, and it’s an approach we’ll continue to explore as we consider how our future computing platforms and devices can best serve people’s needs,” Grosse told Recode. “For any potential future applications of technologies like this, we’ll continue to be public about intended use, how people can have control over these systems and their personal data, and how we’re living up to our responsible innovation framework.” Talking about how the rebrand will affect the atmosphere, It could be mostly not the best thing to do to pan out from the criticism it's getting, and this rebrand appears to not have bought in major changes in the company. And just yet, the metaverse is still under construction, and there are no valid subject points that it would look different than what Facebook is. While other top-list companies were subjected to massive rebranding (not the name), they implemented their technologies immediately waiting for none. Unless there's something new with metaverse in the immediate future, it'll still remain as Facebook.
